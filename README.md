# ProjectAPI
#### Simulation of a software for management of online shops.

The software is used by employees of the shop to manage the inventory, customers, monitor the status of sales and similar tasks in the online shop. It also serve as a common interface to the customers.
Using Flask I developed this project in which the user is able to monitor multiple data and perform tasks such as:

- Get a list of all customers, or a specific customer data
- Register or remove customers to/from the shop
- Password reset in case they forget it
- Add/remove products from the system
- Change the stock of a product
- Get details of products
- Add/Remove products to the Shopping Cart
- Manage customer orders

This are a few listed examples of the taks that you can perform with the help of the developed code.
The backend can be customized by diffent shops to build their own applications based on the provided API.
